Jaanga Terrain repositories with 'SRTM30 Plus' in the title are a set of repositories with derived data or data viewers that relate to the efforts of the: 

[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripps_Institution_of_Oceanography ) at [UCSD]( https://scripps.ucsd.edu/ ).
More specifically, the data is sourced from the Scripps' [Satellite Geodesy]( http://topex.ucsd.edu/index.html ) web site.
And even more specifically to the files relating to the Institution's long-standing effort to supply and maintain a most accurate and most complete 
single source of global bathymetric data based on the [Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuttle_Radar_Topography_Mission ).

The Jaanga Terrain repositories include both open data and open source data viewers. Currently the SRTM30 plus data is available in two formats.

* PNG heightmaps organized in [Tile Mapping Service (TMS)]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service ) format.
* PNG heightmaps organized on a 10x10 degree grid format


## Data Sources

The elevation data used here has been collected from:

<ftp://topex.ucsd.edu/pub/srtm30_plus/topo30/>

From the Read Me:

>The  subdirectory called topo30 has the data 
	stored in a single large file of 2-byte integers
	in MSB format (i.e. big-endian).  The grid spans 
	0 to 360 in longitude and -90 to 90 in latitude. 
	The upper left corner of the upper left grid cell
	has latitude 90 and longitude 0.  There are 
	43200 columns and 21600 rows. A matching source 
	identification file (SID) called topo30_sid is also 
	included.  The sid numbers are stored as unsigned 
	2-byte integers.

An attempt was made to use the [SRTM15 Plus]( ftp://topex.ucsd.edu/pub/srtm15_plus/ ) data file, but the data appears to be in a different format than the SRTM30 Plus data. 
Further efforts are required in order to decipher this format.


## Data Viewers

[Jaanga Terrain SRTM30 Plus Viewers]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-srtm30-plus-viewers/terrain-srtm30-plus-viewers.html ) 

The mission is to be able to view data in 3D as quickly and as easily as possible.

As of this writing, four viewers are supplied. Each only begins to scratch the surface of what is possible.


## Data Derivations

The mission is to help global bathymetric data be readily available to researchers who may have limited programming experience.
The first data set is a collection of PNG heightmaps divided according to the TMS system. 

Data on GitHub:

[TMS 0-7 PNG Files]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-srtm30-plus-data-tms-1-7 )

[TMS 7plus PNG Files]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-srtm30-plus-data-tms-7plus )
Some details as to why the TMS format is used are detailed in this earlier R1 web pag
e:
[Jaanga Terrain Further Considerations]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain/readme-reader.html#further-considerations.md ).

The second set of data is in the format of a 10x10 degree grid

[10 Degree PNG Files]( https://github.com/jaanga/terrain-srtm30-plus-data-10degree )

## Code

The tools to gather, parse and store the data are all built in JavaScript with the help of [node.js]( http://nodejs.org ).

All of these tools are available in the [Jaanga Terrain Cookbook]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-r2/terrain.html#./cookbook/readme.md# ) along with descriptions and background on the application of the tools.
